# @loxoz/types-check

A collection of handy functions to quickly check types in your code.

âœ¨ This library **fully supports TypeScript** and **will infer the checked type** to the variable.

ðŸ‘‰ The main goal of this library is to **reduce bundle size** when checking for types (like more than two or three times) in your **web app**, but i also like this way of writing code with type checks.

## Examples

```js
import {} from '@loxoz/types-check';

let data = null;

fetch("/api/data")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(json => {
    if (isObj(json)) data = json;
  });

// ... somewhere else ...

if (isStr(data.name)) {
    // data.name is now a string
    // ...
}
```

## API

## ðŸ§ª primitives

### isType

```ts
isType(o: any, t: string): o is JSType[T];
```
Exactly the same as a `typeof` (`typeof o === t`) used by other functions of this library to reduce bundle size.

You should check the other functions provided by this library first before using this one.

### isStr

```ts
isStr(o: any): boolean
```

Checks if `o` is a `string`

### isNum

```ts
isNumber(o: any): boolean
```

Checks if `o` is a `number`

### isObj

```ts
isObj(o: any): boolean
```

Checks if `o` is an `object`

This will include class instances, if you don't want that, look at [isObjStrict](#isobjstrict)

For typescript convenience, the inferred type is a Record

*Note*: this function won't include functions and null (`typeof null === "object"` is truthy)

### isFunc

```ts
isFunc(o: any): boolean
```

Checks if `o` is a `function`

> The inferred type is `(...args: unknown[]) => unknown`

### isUndef

```ts
isUndef(o: any): boolean
```

Checks if `o` is either `null` or `undefined`

This function is just here for coding preferences but it can actually save some bundle size if you use it a lot in your code.

Doing `o == null` is exactly the same (since it does that under the hood)

### other

There is also `isBigInt`, `isBool` and `isSymbol`, but they aren't used often so omitted from the docs

## ðŸ“¦ objects

### isArr

```ts
isArr(o: any): boolean
```

Checks if `o` is an `Array` (`any[]`)

### isObjStrict

```ts
isObjStrict(o: any): boolean
```

Will ensure that `o` is an `object` created using `{}`, `Object()` or `Object.create()`

*Warning*: this method is much slower than [isObj](#isobj)

This function won't include class instances, if you want that, look at [isObj](#isobj)

> The inferred type is `{ [x: string | symbol]: any }`

## ðŸ§± helpers

### isNonEmptyStr

```ts
isNonEmptyStr(o: any): boolean
```

Checks if `o` is a `string` with a least one character

### isNonEmptyArr

```ts
isNonEmptyArr(o: any): boolean
```

Checks if `o` is an `Array` (`any[]`) with a least one element

## Advices

- There is no real need for a `isBool` (or `isBoolean`) since you can just do `o === true` or `o === false`.

If you need more complex type checking for example on objects or arrays, i recommend you take a look at [superstruct](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superstruct).
